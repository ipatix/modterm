# modterm
"modterm" is a simple command line based music player for .MOD tracker files. It currently only runs on Linux and on Cygwin.
It only depends on the C-STL and portaudio.

This project was more of a "just for fun" thing and modterm doesn't support all commands but it works for most MOD files that use the old timing accuracy.
